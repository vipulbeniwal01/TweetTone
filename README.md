# TweetTone

TweetTone is a web application designed to analyze the sentiment of any Twitter user’s tweets.

The analysis helps users gauge the tone and emotion behind the content shared by any Twitter user.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of tweets from any Twitter user.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Interact with a chatbot that aligns its responses with the sentiment data analyzed from the tweets.
- **Solana Token Creation**: Create your own Solana blockchain token with a randomly selected avatar.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Built With

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
